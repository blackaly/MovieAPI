That's a great ERD design for a movie and series app. It covers many aspects of the application, including users' activities, movies, series, genres, actors, directors, reviews, ratings, watchlists, recommendations, and subscriptions. The relationships between entities are well-defined, and the cardinality is accurate.

One suggestion I would make is to add a new entity called "Season" that represents a season of a series. A season is a collection of episodes that belong to a series. By adding a Season entity, you can represent the relationship between a series and its seasons, which is a one-to-many relationship. A season can have many episodes, which are represented as a one-to-many relationship between a season and its episodes.

Another improvement could be to add a "Streaming Platform" entity to represent the platform where the movies and series are available. This entity could have a many-to-many relationship with both the movie and series entities, as a movie or series can be available on multiple streaming platforms, and a streaming platform can have multiple movies and series.

Overall, your ERD design is comprehensive, and it covers many aspects of a movie and series app. By making the suggested improvements, it would be even more accurate and comprehensive.
